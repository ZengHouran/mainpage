abstract: The home interface of Virtual Reality (VR) human-computer interaction system determines the consumer's first impression of VR, and it is also the core interface for users to perceive and understand the functional distribution and composition of the entire VR system. However, the current VR home interface design ignores the importance of users' perceptual needs and preferences. This paper attempts to study the relationship between perceptual preferences and design elements in the VR home interfaces by Kansei Engineering. Through the semantic evaluation of the home interface of thirty mainstream HMDs, we analyzed and found that the layout, icon style and the number of cards are the factors that affect perceptual preferences the most. Subsequently, we conducted an experiment on the relationship between these interface design elements and perceptual preferences. Based on the experiment results, it is validated that these interface design elements have varying effects on perception, the icon style has the greatest impact on “future” perception, the interface layout has the greatest impact on “comfort” perception, and the number of cards has the greatest impact on “immersion” perception.
